### Breakdown Notes

The majority of the time was spent building the React app itself (7+ hours), followed by design work (3 hours) and content creation (2.5 hours). Learning React fundamentals through the docs and tutorial took about 2 hours.

All in all, this project took just over 17 hours from start to finish! Over the course of 2.5 weeks ðŸš€
