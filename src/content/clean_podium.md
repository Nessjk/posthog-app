_Making informed decisions about clean beauty products_

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon

Clean Podium is launching soon to help you make confident decisions when purchasing products with truly clean ingredients.

## ðŸŒŸ What We Do

We're starting with beauty products, inspired by the global K-beauty phenomenon. While South Korean beauty products have taken the world by storm, the question remains: **Are these products actually clean?**

### Our Solution

Clean Podium provides comprehensive ingredient analysis by:

- **Ingredient Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of each component and its effects
- **Skin Type Compatibility**: Tailored recommendations for different skin types
- **Safety Alerts**: Highlighting potential side effects (for pregnant users etc)
- **Clean Rating System**: Categorizing products to showcase only the cleanest options

## âš¡ The Technology

This project leverages big data analytics with a custom backend system designed for:

- Advanced product categorization
- Ingredient analysis and breakdown

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

_Keeping you informed and protecting you from unwanted ingredients._
