# 🍕 Pizza Preference Declaration

## On the Matter of Pineapple on Pizza

Dear PostHog Team,

I understand you run stats on your team's pizza preferences. Here's my unsolicited **Pro-Pineapple** application.

### My Position

**STRONGLY IN FAVOR** 🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍

### The Data-Driven Argument

- Point #1: **Flavor Profile Optimization:** The sweet-savory combination creates a statistically significant taste variance that engages more taste receptors simultaneously. Who doesn't want more engagement?

- Point #2: **not enough data...**

### Where This Positions Me at PostHog

Based on my pineapple affinity, I project myself in the following segments:

1. **The bold experimenter quadrant** - My Italian heritage and DNA played against me since birth
2. **The rebelious taste persona** - Questions the status quo (even in pizza toppings)
3. **The "data-over-tradition" cohort** - I let outcomes and data-driven insights speak louder than popular opinion

### Expected Team Dynamics

If PostHog tracks pizza preference NPS, I suspect:

- This makes me statistically interesting
- Diverse opinions lead to better products (and pizza orders)

**Pineapple Preference Confidence Level:** 95% CI

\_P.S. - I'm also flexible on complementary topping but the data says no...pineapple might be enough.
