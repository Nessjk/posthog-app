# My Career Hub

_The job board that became LumenCareers_

## 🌟 Project Evolution

Originally developed as My Career Hub, this project has been spun off to **[LumenCareer.com](https://lumencareer.com)** by my co-founder (we remain great friends!).

## 🎯 Mission & Focus

A specialized job board targeting the Netherlands, specifically designed for:

- **Junior developers** seeking their first tech role
- **Entry-level professionals** starting their careers
- **Students** looking for internship opportunities

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Data Collection

We built a comprehensive scraping system that aggregates job listings from **hundreds of websites** across Holland, ensuring no job slips through our crawlers.

### Smart Matching System

Our **10-step questionnaire** captures candidate preferences, skills, and career goals to intelligently match each person to their ideal job opportunity.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

Built with a modern, scalable tech stack:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Pinia for state management
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible data storage
- **Authentication & Hosting**: Firebase ecosystem
- **Data Pipeline**: Custom web scraping infrastructure in Python

## 🚀 Success Story

We reached 100s of users within the first few weeks. Received great feedback! What started as My Career Hub has grown in LumenCareer under my old co-founder. He continues to help connect Dutch talent with opportunities in the tech industry.
