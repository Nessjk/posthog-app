Every developer has a graveyard of projects that never saw the light of day.

The ones I mentioned in this folder are the ones that actually saw the day light. Got some users (particularly the job board app that reached 100s of users quickly), but then faded or never "took off".

To the 100+ repos sleeping in my github...RIP ⚰️
