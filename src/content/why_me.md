# Why Me?

There are two ways to answer this question: the **emotional way** and the **data-driven way**.

If I was applying for a movie role, I'd definitely start with the emotional side. Picture the hero's journey, the impossible task at hand... but no—let's start with the data-driven answer.

## 📊 The Data-Driven Answer

Here's my equation for "Why Tony?":

```
(product + data + engineering) x customer value = tony
```

**Customer value** is the multiplier that matters most. If nothing gets shipped, no value is added... and anything multiplied by 0 is 0.

### Breaking It Down

- **Product**: I think in user outcomes, not just features
- **Data**: I let metrics guide decisions, not assumptions
- **Engineering**: I build things that scale and ship quickly
- **Customer Value**: The force multiplier that makes everything else matter

## ❤️ The Emotional Answer

I want to be part of an amazing team that sits at the cross-section of data, analytics, and building software. I'm inspired by helping businesses understand the impact of the apps they build and send out into this world—and being part of a big opportunity while doing it.

## 🧠 Data × Emotion = Direction (PostHog..?)

What happens when you multiply data by emotion?

I pondered this over lunch..

And one salad later here's the short answer:

**The answer**: You get **direction**,something meaningful to follow. An opportunity to add value to customers, to a team and company. Inspiring and getting inspired to build the best value driven tech in my career. From the outside PostHog seems to tick all the boxes.

I look forward to meeting you :)

This application is unusual, and that's thanks to **you**—your team, your writing, your culture. All of it made me want to go forward with this unconventional approach.

I would have regretted not taking this shot, and for that opportunity, I thank you!

Isn't life all about regret minimization?
