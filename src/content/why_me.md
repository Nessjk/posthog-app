# Why Me?

There are two ways to answer this question: the **emotional way** and the **data-driven way**.

If I was applying for a movie role, I'd definitely start with the emotional side. Picture the hero's journey, the impossible task at hand... but no‚Äîlet's start with the data-driven answer.

## üìä The Data-Driven Answer

Here's my equation for "Why Tony?":

```
(product + data + engineering) x customer value = tony
```

The exponent is crucial here. **Customer value** is the multiplier that matters most. If nothing gets shipped, no value is added... and anything multiplied by 0 is 0.

### Breaking It Down

- **Product**: I think in user outcomes, not just features
- **Data**: I let metrics guide decisions, not assumptions
- **Engineering**: I build things that scale and ship quickly
- **Customer Value**: The force multiplier that makes everything else matter

## ‚ù§Ô∏è The Emotional Answer

I want to be part of an amazing team that sits at the cross-section of data, analytics, and building software. I'm inspired by helping businesses understand the impact of the apps they build and send out into this world‚Äîand being part of a big opportunity while doing it.

## üß† Data √ó Emotion = Direction

What happens when you multiply data by emotion?

I pondered this over lunch (and one salad later)...

**The answer**: You get **direction**‚Äîsomething meaningful to follow. It's the equilibrium between the left and right sides of the brain, where both are satisfied with the result and there's no regret on either side.

Isn't life all about regret minimization anyway?

## üéØ Why This Application Exists

Is that last paragraph getting off-topic? Absolutely.

But here's the thing: this application is unusual, and that's thanks to **you**‚Äîyour team, your writing, your culture. All of it made me want to go forward with this unconventional approach.

I would have regretted not taking this shot, and for that opportunity, I thank you!
