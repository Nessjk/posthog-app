# Ticker Lab

_A trader's journal for better decision-making_

## 🎯 The Vision

Ticker Lab was designed to help traders review, analyze, and improve their trading strategies through systematic documenting and insights on their trades.

## 💡 Core Features

The platform enabled traders to:

- **Upload Trade Data**: Import trades with screenshots and detailed context
- **Smart Tagging System**: Categorize and tag trades by strategy, setup, or play type
- **Performance Analytics**: Get comprehensive stats on trading performance
- **Visual Insights**: Gallery view of each trade, ability to do complex filtering to find an edge

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

Built with a solid foundation:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Vuex for state management
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible trade data storage
- **Hosting**: Heroku for deployment and scalability

## 📚 Lessons Learned

This project taught valuable lessons about product development:

- **The Challenge**: Scope creep and feature creep gradually made the project unwieldy
- **Beta Testing**: Onboarded ~10 beta users who provided valuable feedback.

- **The Reality**: Lack of funding combined with accumulating tech debt made it difficult to ship the complete vision

## 🔄 Key Takeaway

While Ticker Lab didn't reach production, it reinforced crucial lessons about maintaining focus, managing scope, and the importance of technical sustainability in long-term projects. I wasn't shipping an MVP i was shipping a full app..big mistake!
